### Synopsis

The [ZIDW package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ZIDW) provides functions for analyzing zero-inflated discrete Weibull (ZIDW) models. This package includes parameter estimation for both regression and univariate settings, the distribution functions, functions to generate randomized quantile residuals and a pseudo R2, and plotting of rootograms.

### Documentation

The [help file](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ZIDW) documents the references used for each function.

### Examples

Examples for the ZIDW package are included in the help files for various functions.

### Installation

Released and tested versions of ZIDW are available via the
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) network, and can be installed from within R via

```R
install.packages("ZIDW")
```

### Support

The [issue tickets at the GitHub repo](https://github.com/dsy109/ZIDW/issues)
are the primary bug reporting interface.  As with the other web resources,
previous issues can be searched as well.
